# Out Of The Way
This strategic puzzle game is inspired by the minigame within [BitLife](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3PKjkyudCJe46EIgp0PYXGtrGhzHAYzh), mixed with the fake concept game within [Family Guy](https://familyguy.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Virtual_Stuck_Behind_a_Bus).
Currently, this game is in progress.

The live production link can be found at my [GitHub root](https://vznh.github.io/OutOfTheWay).

This is made for CMPM120, and is the final project. Built using TypeScript, Phaser, and publicly available stock images.
